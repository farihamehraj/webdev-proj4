# webdev-proj4
Create a website for a company using bootstrap. You have to make up the company(it can be about anything, creative/funny/serious). Take inspiration from the examples covered in class but don't copy it exactly! Anything from getbootstrap.com is fair use. Feel free to use any of the material we've covered up until now. And, as always make sure to deploy your website and submit the link to your deployed website here(same thing as with assignment 1 and 2).
